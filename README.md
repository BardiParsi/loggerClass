# loggerClass
 I recently completed a C++20-based metaprogramming project where I designed and implemented a custom LOGGER class using advanced C++ features like variadic templates, constexpr, and type traits. The project leverages metaprogramming to create a flexible logging system that automatically detects and formats various data types based on whether they are printable, using template specialization and SFINAE techniques. I also implemented a simple TCP protocol to connect to port 3000 on a sample IP address, receive an HTTP response, and output the result to the console. Boost Asio was utilized for the network communication, and a custom Buffer_Cleaner class was used to sanitize the received buffer before logging. This project highlights my expertise in C++ metaprogramming, template metaprogramming, and modern C++ standards to create efficient and reusable solutions.
